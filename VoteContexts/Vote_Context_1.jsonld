I know it isn't perfect but we need to get started and iterate along the way. \n\nIf we can't get the constitution approved now the community basically gives up on self governance. \n\nWe all need to explore how to converse around this. At the moment the conversations that I have listened in on are very confrontational, not offering solutions, and essentially arguing over commas.\n\nVote yes, get it done, iterate as a community. "
