    "comment": "BALANCING INCENTIVES AND SUSTAINABILITY: THE CASE OF CARDANO’S TREASURY CUT PROPOSAL\n\nThis governance proposal is to reduce the treasury cut—the percentage of staking rewards diverted to fund ecosystem development—from 20% to 10%.. This essay looks at the arguments for and against. \n\nThis change will turbocharge staking participation, enhance decentralization, and position Cardano as a competitive player in the blockchain space, all while maintaining a sustainable treasury through ADA price growth. \n\nHowever, caution that slashing the treasury’s share could jeopardize funding for critical projects, introduce instability, and hinge too heavily on speculative price increases. This essay explores the merits and risks of the proposal, revealing a deeper tension between short-term incentives and long-term ecosystem health.\n\nTHE CASE FOR A LEANER TREASURY\n\nThe proposal’s core promise is simple: give more to stakers, and the network thrives. By dropping the treasury cut to 10%, staking rewards would rise by 12.5%—for example, lifting the annual percentage yield (APY) from 4.0% to roughly 4.5%. This boost, grounded in the formula R_stakers = 0.90 × R_epoch (up from 0.80 × R_epoch*), isn’t just a perk for ADA holders; it’s a strategic move to secure and decentralize the network. More stakers mean more delegated ADA, spreading influence across a wider pool of operators and diluting the power of large stake pools. Cardano’s ethos of decentralization, a cornerstone since its inception, finds a champion in this adjustment.\n\nBeyond security, the proposal taps into Cardano’s competitive ambitions. Higher rewards could lure users and developers from rival blockchains, especially during market cycles when staking yields sway adoption. Increased transaction activity might follow, reducing reliance on treasury handouts and fostering organic growth—a shift the proposal calls “a more sustainable approach to funding.” Developers, nudged to build projects that drive real utility, could invigorate the ecosystem, making Cardano a hub for innovation. The treasury’s sustainability, proponents argue, doesn’t hinge on a high tax rate but on ADA’s price trajectory. \n\nWith the equation T_future = T_current × P_future / P_current, they contend that even a 10% cut leaves ample funds at higher valuations. Set arbitrarily at 20% during the Shelley era’s launch in 2020, the current rate reflects an early, untested guess rather than economic rigor. Now, with a mature governance framework under the new constitution (permitting cuts between 10% and 30%), Cardano can refine its model. The precedent of the Plutus V3 update—another governance-driven tweak—shows this adaptability in action.\n\n\nTHE RISKS OF CUTTING TOO DEEP\n\nHalving the treasury’s epoch-by-epoch inflow raises red flags about funding. Cardano’s treasury fuels protocol upgrades, research by Input Output Global (IOG), and community initiatives like Project Catalyst. A 10% cut might stretch these resources thin, threatening the network’s ability to innovate and compete long-term. Critics argue that prioritizing staking rewards risks shortchanging the very developments—like cutting-edge cryptography or scalability improvements—that keep Cardano ahead.\n\nThe proposal’s reliance on ADA price appreciation adds another layer of doubt. While T_future = T_current × P_future / P_current paints a rosy picture at higher valuations, prices aren’t guaranteed to climb. If ADA stagnates or dips, the treasury’s real-world value could shrink, leaving it underpowered for ambitious goals. Opponents question whether betting on speculative gains is a prudent substitute for a stable, predictable tax rate—especially when transaction volume, another funding factor, remains modest in Cardano’s still-growing ecosystem.\n\nTiming compounds these concerns. With Cardano transitioning to a new constitution and decentralized governance, tweaking a core parameter now might sow confusion. Stakeholders like delegated representatives (DReps), stake pool operators (SPOs), and the Constitutional Committee need stability to find their footing. A rushed change could misalign expectations and dent confidence, prompting calls to delay until the system matures.\n\nThen there’s the data gap. The proposal leans on staking participation and treasury efficiency but offers little insight into current spending or reserves. Without hard numbers proving 10% suffices, skeptics fear a blind leap that could underfund critical needs. Some even warn of over-incentivizing staking: if rewards soar, ADA holders might hoard rather than spend, locking up supply and stifling liquidity for DeFi or everyday use. A milder cut—say, to 15%—might strike a safer balance, they suggest.\n\n\nSTRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE\n\nAt its heart, this debate pits immediate incentives against enduring sustainability. Proponents envision a leaner, more dynamic Cardano, where higher rewards spark participation and price growth cushions a smaller treasury. They see the 20% cut as a relic of caution, ripe for trimming in a network now equipped to govern itself. Critics counter that aggressive cuts could hollow out the treasury, leaving Cardano vulnerable if price hopes falter or development lags. They view the current rate as a prudent buffer, ensuring the ecosystem’s technological edge and resilience.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe proposal’s pivot point rests on two questions: Is the treasury overfunded, or just right? And how much faith does the community have in ADA’s upward climb? \n\nMy answer to these two questions is yes, the treasury is overfunded. Spending that amount of ADA is going to be difficult to manage. It does not need to be that big. \n\nSecondly I believe that while there are other sources of revenue for Cardano by implementing cross chain solutions, meaning that ADA would not see massive gains in terms of dollar price, the price of ADA is still relatively low and therefore the price rise would balance out a decrease in the treasury contributions. As a final point the increase in reward to stakers would help increase participation in ADA adding inflationary pressure to ADA helping answer the second question. \n\nOn this basis I will vote yes for the proposal.
